# Debug Analysis Summary

## Key Finding: **Data IS Present, Extraction Logic is Failing**

### Evidence:

1. ✅ **Cookies are working** (3 cookies added and sent)
2. ✅ **API requests successful** (Status 200)
3. ✅ **Gzip compression working** (`content-encoding: gzip`)
4. ✅ **Content.js files fetched** (147KB each, 4 files)
5. ✅ **Video IDs ARE in the content.js files!**
   ```bash
   grep "ytimg.com/vi" debug_api_content.js
   # Result: ytimg.com/vi/QYAsLF9KmKk
   ```
6. ❌ **But extraction returns 0 videos**

### The Problem

The content.js files contain the video IDs, but the extraction logic isn't finding them. This suggests:

1. **Possible fletch-render ID mismatch** - The IDs from the API response might not match the URLs
2. **Possible regex pattern issue** - The regex might not be matching the format in API-fetched files
3. **Possible filtering issue** - The creative ID filtering might be too strict

### Debug Files Available

All debug data is saved for manual analysis:

```
/Users/rostoni/Downloads/LocalTransperancy/

Main debug files:
- debug_api_request.json       - Full API request/response details
- debug_api_content.js          - First content.js file (HAS VIDEO ID!)
- debug_api_content_meta.json   - Response headers, cookies, status

Latest comparison directory:
- debug_comparison_20251028_143240/
  - 01_html_result.json         - HTML method (works ✅)
  - 02_cookies.json             - 3 cookies
  - 03_api_result.json          - API method (0 videos ❌)
  - 06_tracker_data.json        - All requests/responses
  - 07_comparison.json          - Side-by-side comparison
```

### Analysis Commands

```bash
cd /Users/rostoni/Downloads/LocalTransperancy

# 1. Verify video IDs are in content.js
grep -i "ytimg.com/vi" debug_api_content.js

# 2. Search for specific video IDs
grep -i "C_NGOLQCcBo\|df0Aym2cJDM\|QYAsLF9KmKk" debug_api_content.js

# 3. Check fletch-render IDs in content.js URLs
cat debug_api_content_meta.json | jq '.url'

# 4. Compare API response content.js URLs
cat debug_api_request.json | jq '.response_text_preview' | grep -o "fletch-render-[0-9]*"

# 5. Check creative ID filtering
cat debug_api_request.json | jq '.response_text_preview' | grep -o "creativeId[^&]*"
```

### Next Steps to Fix

The issue is in the extraction logic in `_extract_data()` function. Possible fixes:

1. **Check fletch-render ID extraction from API** - Compare what IDs are extracted vs what's in URLs
2. **Verify creative ID matching** - The real_creative_id might not match what's in content.js
3. **Test regex patterns** - Run the extraction regex directly on debug_api_content.js
4. **Disable filtering temporarily** - Try extracting from ALL content.js without filtering

### Comparison: HTML vs API Method

| Metric | HTML Method | API Method |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Cookies extracted | 0 (separate context) | 3 ✅ |
| API request | ✅ | ✅ |
| Content.js fetched | 4 files | 4 files |
| Video IDs in files | ✅ Present | ✅ Present |
| Videos extracted | 2 ✅ | 0 ❌ |
| App Store ID | ✅ | ❌ |

### The Core Issue

**The extraction/filtering logic treats API-fetched content.js differently than HTML-captured ones.**

Possible reasons:
- Fletch-render IDs don't match
- Creative ID filtering is too strict
- Different data structure in API response
- Regex patterns don't match API format

### Recommended Fix

1. Compare fletch-render IDs from API response vs content.js URLs
2. Log what the extraction logic is actually receiving
3. Temporarily disable creative ID filtering to see if ALL videos get extracted
4. If that works, fix the filtering logic to match API-fetched content
