## Key Differences Between the Two Failures

### 1. Advertiser Size
| Aspect | Creative #1 | Creative #2 |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **Advertiser** | Fugo Games FZCO | COE Services Ltd |
| **Total Creatives** | 40+ active | 3 active |
| **Type** | Large advertiser | Small advertiser |
| **Category** | Gaming company | Services company |

### 2. Content.js Files Loaded
| Aspect | Creative #1 | Creative #2 |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **Total files** | 7 files | 4 files |
| **Other creatives loaded** | 6 different creatives | 3 different creatives |
| **File sizes** | 2540-2769 lines each | 954 lines each |
| **Content type** | More complex ads (larger files) | Simpler ads (smaller files) |

### 3. Traffic Differences
| Metric | Creative #1 | Creative #2 | Difference |
|--------|------------|------------|-----------|
| **Requests** | 50 | 38 | +31.6% more |
| **Blocked** | 28 | 25 | +12% more |
| **Outgoing** | 36.90 KB | 26.39 KB | +39.9% more |
| **Duration** | 6.67s | 6.19s | +7.8% slower |

### 4. Error Detection
| Phase | Creative #1 | Creative #2 |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **Empty GetCreativeById detected** | 1.5s | 1.5s |
| **Wait time** | 3s for SearchCreatives | 3s for SearchCreatives |
| **Early exit** | 4.5s | 4.5s |
| **Total time** | 6.67s | 6.19s |

---

## What's the SAME Between Both Failures?

1. ‚úÖ **Same error type**: "Creative not found in API"
2. ‚úÖ **Same detection logic**: GetCreativeById returns `{}`
3. ‚úÖ **Same validation**: Creative NOT in SearchCreatives list
4. ‚úÖ **Same scraper behavior**: Smart early exit after 4.5s
5. ‚úÖ **Same conclusion**: Both creatives have been removed/expired

---

## Why Content.js Files Were Still Loaded?

Even though the target creative doesn't exist, Google's transparency page still loaded content.js files from **OTHER creatives** belonging to the same advertiser. This is because:

1. The page framework loads regardless of whether the specific creative exists
2. The advertiser page shows other active creatives as "related content"
3. The scraper captured these background requests but correctly identified they're not the target creative

## Scraper Performance Analysis

### ‚úÖ What Worked Well

1. **Smart early exit**: Detected both failures in 4.5-5s instead of waiting 60s
2. **API capture**: Successfully captured all 4 API responses for both creatives
3. **Empty GetCreativeById detection**: Identified empty response immediately
4. **SearchCreatives verification**: Correctly verified creative not in list
5. **Content.js filtering**: Captured other creatives but didn't extract from wrong creatives
6. **Error reporting**: Clear error message "Creative not found in API"

## Database Error Classification

If you're storing these errors in a database, here's how to classify them:

### Error Type: `CREATIVE_NOT_FOUND`

**Sub-classifications:**

1. **CREATIVE_NOT_FOUND_LARGE_ADVERTISER**
   - Creative ID: CR10267989292483608577
   - Advertiser has 40+ other active creatives
   - Likely: Campaign ended but advertiser still active

2. **CREATIVE_NOT_FOUND_SMALL_ADVERTISER**
   - Creative ID: CR00009427058077728769
   - Advertiser has only 3 other active creatives
   - Likely: Small campaign that ended

### Suggested Database Fields

```json

  "creative_id": "CR10267989292483608577",
  "advertiser_id": "AR07532929654257090561",

  "total_scrape_time_seconds": 6.67,
  "early_exit": true,
  "content_js_from_other_creatives": 6,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-26T17:44:35Z"
}
```

## Conclusion

Both creatives failed with the **SAME fundamental error**: they don't exist in Google's Ads Transparency Center.

**Key Difference**: The SIZE of the advertiser and the AMOUNT of content loaded:
- Creative #1: Large advertiser (40+ creatives), loaded 6 other creatives
- Creative #2: Small advertiser (3 creatives), loaded 3 other creatives

The scraper correctly identified both failures and exited early, demonstrating robust error handling.

**Recommendation**: In your database, store both the main error type (`CREATIVE_NOT_FOUND`) and the advertiser context (number of other creatives) to better understand the failure patterns.
